# Determining your SAP applications
{: #determine-apps}

You need to determine which SAP-based applications you plan to run on your {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSysShort}} colocated and connected with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. Items to consider include:

 * How will the database be used? There are two ways that SAP HANA can be deployed. The first is as a database to an SAP NetWeaver stack, where it primarily serves as a data source. The second deployment method is to run SAP HANA in a stand-alone mode with applications deployed directly in the SAP HANA system. Either way, the sizing process, and other system requirements and dependencies might differ based on how you use your system (development and testing, proof of concept, or production).
 * How do you intend to use the applications? Is the intended use for development and testing, or production?
