# Getting SAP and IBM Cloud credentials and create accounts
{: #get_sap_ibm_credentials}

The following steps provide guidance on how to obtain the necessary credentials for SAP and {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.
{: shortdesc}

## SAP credentials and accounts for new users
{: #sap_credentials}

1. Set up an account on the [SAP home page](https://www.sap.com/index.html){: external} and follow the instructions.

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials and accounts for new users
{: #ibm_credentials}

1. Go to [Get started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/get-started){: external} and click **Create an account**.
2. Enter your IBMid email address. If you don't have an existing IBMid, an ID is created based on the email that you enter.
3. Complete the remaining fields with your information, and click **Create account**.
4. Confirm your account by clicking the link in the confirmation email that's sent to your provided email address.

   You will receive an email from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support containing your verification code, from which you can create your initial login ID and password.

5. Set up your [profile](/docs/account?topic=account-usersettings#profile-photo) to log in as a new user. You can create other accounts and create new users after you receive your login credentials, and you have connectivity to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network.

6. Set up IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM lets you manage your users and access to your resources. For more information, see [Managing Power Systems Virtual Servers (IAM)](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-managing-resources-and-users).
